1. Making the syrup
   to make the syrup you need to place the water and sugar in a saucepan
   and let that simmer. Keep stirring to dissolve the sugar then you can
   take it off heat.

2. Juicing the lemons. 
   While your water is off boiling, you can bust yourself by juicing 4 to 
   6 lemons depending on their size.

3. Putting it all together.
   Pour the lemon juice and syrup into a pitcher and add your cold water, 
   if you like you can also add ice cubes and thin slices of lemon but 
   beware, the ice will dilute your lemonade as it melts.

4. Refridgerate for as long as you want.

  bon appétit. Je suppose que même si ce n'est pas un repas, c'est un verre.
